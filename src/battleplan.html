                The party wakes up hazey in a run-down shack around a magical circle. Knocking and hushed whispers can be heard.
                <br><br>
                <strong>DC 12 Perception Check</strong> makes the whispers audible.
                "Quickly come up with something! She was supposed to
                be back already"
                <br><br>
                Moving towards the sounds reveals two Succubusses in their original forms. Seeing the party they will attack and attempt to charm them. Jurgen will bash in the door at the first sign of trouble, joining the battle.
                <br><br>
                Jurgen engages in a conversation with the party, speculating on what has happened last night. He explains that the festival is over and that sadly he has no more in his Inn. He suggests the party stay in this house for the night and come see him the next morning at the Owl's Nest Inn.

                Next morning Jurgen tells the party that from what he's gathered nothing more fishy has happened.
                <br><br>
                "No one's been stabbed during the festival.
                That's a new one for Rathir."
                <br><br>
                He asks the party if they want to persue the Succubi case.
                <br><br>
                "From what I've seen you're a capable bunch. Question is: what are you going to do with it? I'd look towards The Pit.
                Don't know much about it but folks seem to be scared of it.
                As good a place as any to start looking for the source."

                After hearing the bad news, Rolf's mother asks the party to relay the information to his father. He works at the lumbermill an hour away from the city. Sadly he has not shown up to work.
                Foreman Tark is friends with Donn.
                <br><br>
                "I don't know where he is. He never missed a day, even when hangover. Truth be told I am worried. If you find him, tell him to get back to work."
                <br><br>
                Leaving, the party spots a track of work clothes leading into bushes. Donn lays there, devoid of life. A succubus' doing most likely. It looks like the killer took a trophy, his wedding ring.
                <br><br>
                After some persuasion, the foreman reveals that Donn had an affair with one of the ladies of the night. He's never seen her though, nor does he know her name.

                Arriving at The Pit, the party sees a couple of Red Legion Bandits dumping crates down the canyon. There are many beartraps around the camp. If any of the traps are triggered, bandits jump into formation and search the area.

                Descending using the grappling hook, the party finds themselves slowly going down multiple stone shelves. Around 400ft. down they finally reach The Pit's floor. It's covered with all kinds of filth and trash. It appears that the locals have been using it as a landslide for years. The stench of death and decay is overwhelming requiring a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw
                to stave off the Poisoned Condition. Going further a blue glow can be seen in the distance. This turns out to be a blue floating orb above a magic circle. Both the circle and surrounding area is covered with bodies. All belonging to the same dwarf in different states of decay.
                <br><br>
                A hungry and well-hidden Otyough ambushes the party in hopes of an easy dinner. Being used to being the ultimate predator, it will not back down even if gravely injured.
